# Requiem-Save-Updater
A bypass for the annoying save file signature check done in Yu-Gi-Oh! Legacy of the Duelist: Link Evolution:

Also a script to reset only some of the campaign duels in your Yu-Gi-Oh! Legacy of the Duelist: Link Evolution save file, pre-prepared to be used for the Requiem Mod. This is useful so you can "convert" your base game save into a Requiem-friendly save, with all Bonus and Modified duels available and not completed.

# Tutorial

- Find your save folder ("C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\userdata\YOUR STEAM ID\1150640\remote") and your game executable folder ("C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Yu-Gi-Oh! Legacy of the Duelist Link Evolution").
- Download the latest release: https://github.com/ArthurGiannotta/Requiem-Save-Updater/releases/tag/Release
- Extract your zip file " Requiem.Save.Updater.zip"
- Copy either or both your save file "savegame.dat" and the game executable "YuGiOh.exe" into the same folder you extracted in the last step.

- Rename and replace your original save game with the new "savegame - requiem.dat" and also the new executable "YuGiOh - Bypassed.exe". If you don't want to keep using the modified executable, you can run it only once, then either buy some packs or play a duel. The next save generated by the game will have a valid signature and can be played with the original executable.
