# Requiem-Save-Updater
A bypass for the annoying save file signature check done in Yu-Gi-Oh! Legacy of the Duelist: Link Evolution:

Also a script to reset only some of the campaign duels in your Yu-Gi-Oh! Legacy of the Duelist: Link Evolution save file, pre-prepared to be used for the Requiem Mod. This is useful so you can "convert" your base game save into a Requiem-friendly save, with all Bonus and Modified duels available and not completed.
